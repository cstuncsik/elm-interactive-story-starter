You hand over the envelope.  "Yes, that's it!  You found them!  You've saved me, how can I ever repay you?"

"Don't bother, just... good luck."

Well that wraps that up in a nice little package.  But it's still a mystery why you are here.

The old man calls you back.  "Oh, hey!  I think you should have this."

He reaches into his pocket and hands you something.  A sticker.
