From the back of the room you can see the moderator at the podium on the stage, addressing a full audience.  She seems to be stalling for time.

"... and I see our next speaker has just arrived!  Without further ado, I'll turn microphone over."  She steps aside and the whole room turns around to look back at you.

"Our study focused on measuring altered cellular oxidation-reductions in mitochondrial..."

Eyes begin glazing over.  That goes on for at least 20 minutes.  Finally you finish the last page.

"... in conclusion, the study failed to return a significant correlation to the hypothesis.  No questions?  Great, see ya'!"

Half the audience has fallen asleep.  You slink off stage.  At least that's done.
